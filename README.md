# hello-world
This repo is for learning and practicing Github flows. I've worked as a UX writer for almost 10 years, but lately, I've become very interested in learning to code. My experience so far has matched up with this quote by Andy Hertzfeld about programming:

"There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like because you have to do very precise thinking. On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitations."
